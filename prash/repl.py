"""Prash REPL (PRASH_V2.md §6b) — a persistent interactive session.

Not a new command set: the REPL re-invokes the existing argparse parser per
line, so every `cmd_*` entry point works exactly as in one-shot mode. What
makes it a session (and not just a prompt loop) is short-lived context that
is carried between lines:

    prash repl
    prash> fix api-7f9d                 -> uses the remembered namespace
    prash> fix it                       -> stage 2: resolves to the remembered pod
    prash> restart the broken api pod   -> stage 2: free text -> run restart-pod
    prash> watch                        -> uses the remembered namespace
    prash> exit

Stage 1 = the session + context. Stage 2 (`prash/intent.py`) = free-text
intent parsing with clarifying follow-ups when the target is ambiguous. A
line that parses as an exact command always wins; stage 2 only handles what
argparse can't. `q`/`exit`/`quit`/Ctrl+D end the session; `help` prints the
parser's usage.
