"""Action: exec (Track C, sprint-2 Kubernetes Depth, PRASH_V2.md §7b).

Last piece of "Kubernetes Actions." Deliberately different in kind from
restart-pod/rollback/scale/edit-configmap/edit-secret, not just in degree:
every other action here does one well-defined Kubernetes API mutation.
This runs an arbitrary command inside a live container -- unbounded blast
radius, bounded only by what the container's own user and filesystem
permit. Discussed explicitly with Aradhya before building (2026-08-17,
PRASH_V2.md §9): scoped to RiskTier.APPROVAL, same permission pattern as
every other action here, no command allowlist and no automated-brain
carve-out -- the permission system is the safety net, consistent with how
this whole action model already works. A stricter posture (restricted
command set, keeping it out of brain-automated paths) was considered and
explicitly not chosen for this first version.

Wired to Track B's Kubernetes connector (prash/connectors/kubernetes.py,
owned by Aradhya) -- same split as every other action: the connector runs
the single operation, this action owns planning, permission gating, and
verification.
