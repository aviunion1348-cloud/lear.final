"""Action: apply-ci-fix.

Closes the gap found live-testing `prash fix --ci` (PRASH_V2.md §9,
2026-08-15, CROSS-TRACK entry): the CI multi-failure path diagnosed real
problems and proposed real file changes, but never actually did anything
with them -- the "Fixed X of N" headline was true only in the sense that
the model had *proposed* a fix, not that one existed anywhere.

This is the first action where Prash writes AI-generated code into a real
repository, rather than reading state or acting on infrastructure that
already exists (restart-pod, rollback) or opening a PR between two branches
that already exist (open-pr). No local git clone: everything goes through
GitHub's Git Data API, which `GitHubConnector` already has the plumbing for.
