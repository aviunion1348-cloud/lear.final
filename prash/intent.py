"""REPL stage 2 (PRASH_V2.md §6b): free-text intent -> command resolution.

Stage 1 made the REPL a persistent session with context; stage 2 lets the
user type the way they'd talk to a person instead of the way they'd call a
CLI: "my api pod is sick, fix it" -> `fix prash-demo/api-...`. Deliberately
narrow and honest: if intent can't be resolved with real confidence, this
module says so and the caller asks a clarifying question rather than guessing
and running the wrong command against real infrastructure.

Two-stage by design:
    resolve(text, session) -> Suggestion | Clarify | None
        Suggestion  -> argv to run (already context-resolved) + an explanation
        Clarify     -> a question to ask, with concrete known options
        None        -> genuinely couldn't resolve it, fast or otherwise

The fast path (_verb_hit + the target regexes below) is pure and free --
zero latency, zero API cost, unit-testable headlessly. When it doesn't
recognize the text at all (Milestone 2, 2026-08-24), resolve() falls back
to routing it through the same tool-calling brain the diagnosis pipeline
uses (prash/brain/kimi_client.py's call_with_tool), built dynamically from
the real provider/action registries so a new connector never needs a
hand-added verb here. That fallback does real I/O and can fail (missing
credentials, model/network trouble) -- it degrades to None on any failure,
same contract as the fast path, never a crash.
