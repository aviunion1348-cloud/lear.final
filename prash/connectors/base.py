"""Connector pattern, ported from v1's vercel_client.py:

    authenticate -> locate resource -> fetch logs -> poll state

Every read/write connector implements this shape so Track B connectors (k8s,
Cloud Run, AWS) and Track C write actions all share one contract. Connectors
hold no credentials of their own: they receive them per-call from the local
CredentialStore.
