"""Track D tier 2 — the multi-failure fix. See PRASH_V2.md §6/§9.

The atomic-fix model breaks on real repos: "one root cause -> one diagnosis
-> one PR" assumes N=1 independent failure, but real broken CI is usually
N independent failures across N jobs. The AgentCore case (2026-08-03, see
ROADMAP.md) had 4: backend ruff errors, a contracts drift, frontend biome
errors, a mobile parity issue -- completely unrelated causes in completely
unrelated jobs. The old pipeline either picked one job and left the rest
unfixed (silently reported as if the whole thing were resolved), or gave up
entirely with a single manual_required covering none of them.

The fix: split by failing job, diagnose each independently (they're
independent problems, not fragments of one), and report "fixed 3 of 4" as
a real partial success -- not "verified: true/false" as the only two
possible outcomes. Fixing most of a multi-failure run is real progress;
scoring it as total failure because it wasn't literally everything is
exactly the bug this closes.

Done when: an AgentCore-shaped case (N independent failures, not all
fixable) produces N-1 real fixes instead of one manual_required covering
nothing. Validated live against a synthetic case matching that shape
(PRASH_V2.md §10, 2026-08-09) -- the original AgentCore run itself isn't
re-fetchable here, this repo has no access to v1's specific historical
GitHub run.
