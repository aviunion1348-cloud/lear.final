"""Ported from prash-backend/app/agent/schemas.py (2026-08-09, Track D days 4-5),
extended with a "runtime" category and a recommended_action field.

The extension: v1's Diagnosis is entirely code-diff-shaped (fix_type +
files_changed) -- there was no way to represent "a running service is
unhealthy" (PRASH_V2.md \xa79, second review pass). A crash-looping pod's
fix isn't a file diff, it's an action (restart, rollback), so this adds
the minimal surface for that rather than redesigning fix_type itself:
- category gains "runtime"
- recommended_action carries which action to propose, mirroring the
  action ids Track C already built (restart_pod, rollback)

fix_type naturally resolves to manual_required for category="runtime"
via the existing coerce_fix_type validator (no files_changed => no code
fix) -- the CLI/dispatcher reads recommended_action instead when
deciding what to propose for a runtime diagnosis. Not schema-enforced
that recommended_action is only set for category="runtime", matching
how required_secrets is scoped to category="environment" by convention
and prompt instruction, not a hard validator, in v1 too.

    Added 2026-08-17 (PRASH_V2.md §9) after live stress-testing found that

    shape) silently drops content the model doesn't fully attend to — two

    comment lines, with the model's own explanation claiming "everything
    else is untouched" when the diff proved otherwise. There was no
    mechanism to catch this: new_content was trusted as the complete file
    and written straight to a blob.

    old_content must match the current file exactly and uniquely — the same
    contract Prash's own coding-agent Edit tool uses, deliberately, since
    that's a pattern models are already well-trained to produce reliably.

    context, tried previously and abandoned — see the "patch" field warning
    this replaces in diagnosis_agent.py's prompt — fragile against whitespace
    drift). An exact substring match has no line numbers to get wrong: it

# A live CI-fix apply failed purely on whitespace drift: the model's

# didn't match the real (deeply class-nested) file byte-for-byte, so the exact
# substring match found nothing and the fix — and the PR — never happened. The
# diagnosis was correct; only the mechanical apply lost.

# whitespace / CRLF, and a uniform indent shift — WITHOUT weakening the core
# safety guarantee. Every tier still demands a single, unambiguous line-window
# match and splices the ORIGINAL file's own bytes for the surround, so content
# the model never mentioned still cannot be silently lost or rewritten. Partial
# intra-line substring edits are left to the exact path; the fallback is
