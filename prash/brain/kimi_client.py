"""Ported from prash-backend/app/agent/kimi_client.py (2026-08-09, Track D days 4-5).

All model-calling logic (the two-step Kimi reasoning/structured flow, DeepSeek's
single-call native-thinking pattern, cross-provider fallback chain, transient-error
retries) is UNCHANGED from v1 -- that's the valuable IP, zero coupling to the hosted
stack, confirmed by reading the file, not just PRASH_V2.md's earlier assessment.

Two plumbing changes, per PRASH_V2.md §6's "port after a trivial fix" note --
turned out to be a bit more than trivial, but contained to this file:

1. No Supabase. v1's `_log_agent_call`/`mark_agent_run_outcome` wrote to an
   `agent_calls` table; v2 has no database by design (§4/§7). Ported as local
   logger calls instead of no-ops, so call detail isn't silently discarded --
   same signatures, so diagnosis_agent.py needed zero changes to keep calling them.
2. Lazy client construction. v1 built `kimi`/`deepseek` as AsyncOpenAI clients at
   MODULE IMPORT TIME from a pydantic Settings object that requires the env vars
   to exist. v2 has no such Settings class (CredentialStore is deliberately
   dependency-free, see prash/credentials.py), and eager construction would crash
   on import in any environment without KIMI_API_KEY set -- including every test
   run. Replaced with lazy singleton getters reading os.environ directly, matching
   the exact pattern prash/connectors/kubernetes.py's _client() already uses.
