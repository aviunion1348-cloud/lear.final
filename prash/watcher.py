"""Track E — the watcher. Owner: Aradhya. See PRASH_V2.md §6, days 9-11.

Poll loop over Track B's Kubernetes connector, watching for the four states
Track D's brain is taught to diagnose (§8): CrashLoopBackOff, OOMKilled,
ImagePullBackOff, and stuck-pending — the connector's own _classify() already
does the hard detection work, so this module's job is narrower: poll on an
interval, remember what's already been reported so it doesn't re-notify every
cycle for an ongoing problem, and fire a desktop notification on the moment a
NEW problem appears. One source done properly, not many done shallowly (§6).

Not a background daemon (§2's "always-on" framing is a later-sprint question,
explicitly out of scope this sprint per §7 — no hosted layer). This is a
foreground `prash watch` process the user runs and leaves open, matching the
CLI-only scope this sprint committed to.

# ── M5 (spec §4d): one multi-connector watch loop over the Connector interface ──
# Before this, AWS and GCP each had their own near-identical ~55-line loop, and a
# third (terraform) and the k8s pod-problem loop lived separately. The AWS/GCP
# pair was pure copy-paste over the same interface calls (poll_state + get_stats),
# so they now share ONE loop that drives *any* connector — and reads every watch
# in a cycle in PARALLEL, not one-after-another (the §3 "parallel vs sequential"
# speed lever). k8s's richer pod-problem model (run_watch_loop / detect_changes)
# and terraform's drift model stay specialized — they aren't get_stats time
# series — so no connector loses a capability it had (§4e).
